            <p>This deck is designed to give a cursory knowledge of playbook writing as well as introduce some advanced
		methods.  The purpose is to demonstrate and expose students to the awareness of Ansible and its features,
		as well as how that directly coordinates to the story of Ansible Tower.

		Students are encouraged to follow along at their own pace, go faster or slower as they wish, and bypass
		the hands-on labs completely if that's their desire.</p>
